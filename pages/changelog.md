@page change-log Change log

All notable changes to this style guide will be documented on this page.

The style guide will be maintained under the 
[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) guidelines 
as much as possible. Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

- Breaking backward compatibility (e.g. changing class or file names) 
bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
- Adding new pages, stylesheets and CSS classes without breaking backward 
compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
- Changes to existing classes, pages and other misc. changes (e.g. updating
the guide's layout) bumps the patch

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/). 

## 1.0.0 - 2016-04-26
