Versioning
Font Awesome will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible. Releases will be numbered with the following format:

<major>.<minor>.<patch>

And constructed with the following guidelines:

Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
New additions, including new icons, without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
Bug fixes, changes to brand logos, and misc changes bumps the patch
